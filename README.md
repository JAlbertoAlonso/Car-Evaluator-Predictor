[Description]
- Exploratory Data Analysis of the transactions dataset data.<br>
- Describe which are the features of the best and the worst car in the market according to the users.<br>
- Perform an analysis of the characteristics that will adjust the model.<br>
- Perform an oversampling to balance the data set.<br>
- Create and train a Random Forest model, seeking to fine-tune its hyperparameters as much as possible using a Cross Validation search mesh.<br>
- Obtain predictions from the model with the adjusted hyperparameters.<br>
- Perform the metrics regard to the model created.<br>
- Draw conclusions regarding the entire process.<br>
